- came up with project idea
- pulled data from the USDA site
- cleaned data, including separating the variable Form into 3 different variables, change variable unit names, and combine multiple datasets into one data set
- acquire the least and most expensive fruit across the whole dataset
- acquire the least and most expensive fruit among different type of fruit products 

03/28/17
- added description for project part I
- further increased fruit type into 6 categories 
- added bar chart of all products, colored by fruit types
- for the bar chart above, plot the sorted version for a better visualization. 
- compared standard deviation of average price per cup between fruit types
- compared average of average price per cup and preparation yield ratio to come up with the fruit with highest investment value. 

03/29/17
- added 4 different master data files
- Go through each file and come up with ways to extract data from different worksheets

03/30/17
- try to come up with one code to pull data from all files
- came up with the investigation questions below after exploring the data: 
	1. Use data with Fresh and Processed prices to compare the trend between the two
	2. Use the data with All to compare trend between fruits
- We will investigate #1 above in part II of the project, and #2 in part III of the project. 

03/31/17
- added description for project part II
- cleaned the data for fruit with fresh, processed, and all prices
- made 5 figures on grower prices on fresh and processed fruits (decided to omit all prices as it's a mixture of fresh/processed fruit prices)
- wrote conclusion for part II, wrapped it up
- finished part III as well 

04/05/17
- applied several machine learning techniques in Part I to see if we can use other variables to predict the price group
